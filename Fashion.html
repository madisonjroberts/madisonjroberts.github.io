  My style changes everyday, I get inspired by friends, social media, and what I see when I go shopping. I always like to see what is trending. My favorite season would have to be fall because of the boots and sweaters but you cant go wrong in the summer with shorts and sundresses. I love dressing casual with ripped jeans and cute tank top covered by a sweater it is deffinitely my go to. I love expressing myself with what I wear, like they say "you look good you feel good".
