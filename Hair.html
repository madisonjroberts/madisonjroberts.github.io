<h1> Everyday hair routine</h1>

<p> I wash my hair everyday even though people say it's bad for your hair although, sometimes I skip a day or two because its good for your hair to absorb its natural oils. Because my hair is highlighted, lightened, and ombred through out the past couple years I use a great quality set of conditioner and shampoo called Wella Brillance for colored hair.  <p/>

<p> Depending on my mood I will either take a flat iron and straighten my hair or I will use my curling wand and create beachy waves to conquer my day. Some days a simple bun will do or a messy pony. I love trying new things and I always make sure I spray my heat protection through out my hair to reduce heat damage. When showering I make sure to only apply conditioner on my ends to give them extra loving and it reduces split ends and doesnt take away too many of my natural oils in my scalp.  <p/>
